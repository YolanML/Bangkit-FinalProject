# Bangkit-FinalProject
Project name : Dampingi

Dampingi is an application that can help blind people carry out normal activities with the help of object detection.

Our dataset contains:
- Platter
- Person
- Spoon
- Toilet
- Toilet paper

the model we are trying to make here is:
- YOLOv3 (filename: experiment_model1.ipynb)
- CNN (filename: blind_app_model.ipynb)

By using YOLOv3 Object Detection with Darknet, we also use AlexeyAB's github to clone the darknet, link :
AlexeyAB/darknet: YOLOv4 / Scaled-YOLOv4 / YOLO - Neural Networks for Object Detection (Windows and Linux version of Darknet ) (github.com)
